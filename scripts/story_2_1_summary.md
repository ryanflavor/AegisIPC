# Story 2.1 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Story 2.1 has been successfully implemented with all 4 acceptance criteria met. The implementation adds automatic heartbeat functionality and instance-level failover to the AegisIPC system.

## Implemented Features

### AC1: Automatic Heartbeat After Registration ✓
- Added `heartbeat_enabled` and `heartbeat_interval` to `ServiceClientConfig`
- ServiceClient automatically starts heartbeats after successful registration
- Default configuration: enabled=True, interval=5.0 seconds
- Heartbeats continue until service is unregistered or disconnected

### AC2: Health Status Management ✓
- HealthChecker service monitors instances with configurable intervals
- Marks instances as UNHEALTHY when heartbeat timeout is exceeded
- Default timeout: 30 seconds (absolute, not based on missed beats)
- Health status changes trigger events for monitoring

### AC3: Unhealthy Instance Filtering ✓
- `get_healthy_instances()` automatically filters out unhealthy instances
- Routing service only considers healthy instances for load balancing
- Unhealthy instances are excluded from the routing pool

### AC4: Instance-Level Retry ✓
- Added `call_with_failover()` method to ServiceClient
- Automatically retries failed calls on different healthy instances
- RouteRequest model includes `excluded_instances` field
- RoutingService respects excluded instances during routing

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. Heartbeat Protocol
```python
# Heartbeat payload structure
{
    "service_name": "service-name",
    "instance_id": "instance-id",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-24T12:00:00Z",
    "status": "healthy"
}
```

### 2. Configuration
```python
# ServiceClientConfig with heartbeat settings
config = ServiceClientConfig(
    heartbeat_enabled=True,    # Default: True
    heartbeat_interval=5.0,    # Default: 5 seconds
)
```

### 3. Instance Failover
```python
# Call with automatic failover
result = await client.call_with_failover(
    service_name="my-service",
    method="process",
    max_retries=3,  # Try up to 3 different instances
)
```

## Files Modified/Created

### Core Implementation Files:
- `/packages/ipc_client_sdk/ipc_client_sdk/clients/service_client.py` - Added heartbeat config and automatic start
- `/packages/ipc_router/ipc_router/application/models/routing_models.py` - Added HeartbeatRequest/Response models
- `/packages/ipc_router/ipc_router/application/services/routing_service.py` - Enhanced to filter excluded instances
- `/packages/ipc_router/ipc_router/infrastructure/messaging/handlers/heartbeat_handler.py` - Updated to use new models
- `/packages/ipc_router/ipc_router/infrastructure/messaging/handlers/route_handler.py` - Added instance-level failure tracking
- `/packages/ipc_router/ipc_router/infrastructure/monitoring/metrics.py` - Added heartbeat and failover metrics

### Test Files:

- `/packages/ipc_router/tests/integration/test_heartbeat_health_integration.py` - Integration tests
- `/packages/ipc_client_sdk/tests/unit/test_service_client_heartbeat.py` - Unit tests for automatic heartbeat

### Documentation:
- `/packages/ipc_router/monitoring/health_dashboard_queries.md` - Prometheus queries and Grafana config
- `/scripts/demo_story_2_1_nats.py` - Demonstration script
- `/scripts/verify_story_2_1_implementation.py` - Verification script

## Key Differences from Story 1.5
- **Story 1.5**: Message-level retry on same instance for delivery guarantees
- **Story 2.1**: Instance-level retry on different healthy instances for high availability
- Both mechanisms coexist and serve complementary purposes

## Testing Notes
The demo script (`demo_story_2_1_nats.py`) demonstrates:
1. Services automatically sending heartbeats after registration
2. Instances being marked unhealthy when heartbeats stop
3. Unhealthy instances being excluded from routing
4. Failed calls automatically retrying on different instances

## Next Steps
- Story 2.2 will add active/standby role management
- Story 2.3 will implement automatic failover logic
- Consider adjusting heartbeat intervals based on deployment requirements
