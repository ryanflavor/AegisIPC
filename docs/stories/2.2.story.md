# Story 2.2: Support Active/Standby Service Registration Mode

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** service instance,
**I want** to declare my role as "active" or "standby" when registering to handle specific resources,
**so that** the system can establish clear active/standby relationships for high availability.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Registration interface adds role parameter (active/standby)
2. Same resource can only have one active instance at a time
3. Duplicate active role registrations are rejected with appropriate error
4. Management interface displays active/standby relationships

  - [x] Create integration tests for role change events

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
- Story 2.1 implemented automatic heartbeat and health check infrastructure
- `HeartbeatHandler` and `HealthChecker` are already operational
- Instance failover retry mechanism exists but doesn't consider roles yet
- Story 2.3 will build on this to implement automatic failover from active to standby

### Data Models
**ServiceRole Enum** - Create new enum in `ipc_router/domain/enums.py`:
- Values: `ACTIVE`, `STANDBY`
- [Source: architecture analysis - domain layer pattern]

**ServiceInstance Entity** - Extend in `ipc_router/domain/entities/service.py`:
- Add field: `role: Optional[ServiceRole] = None`
- [Source: architecture/4-组件-components.md]

**ServiceRegistrationRequest** - Update in `ipc_client_sdk/ipc_client_sdk/models/service_models.py`:
- Add field: `role: Optional[Literal["active", "standby"]] = "standby"`
- [Source: architecture pattern - Pydantic models for validation]

### API Specifications
**Registration Handler** (`ipc_router/infrastructure/messaging/handlers/registration_handler.py`):
- NATS subject: `ipc.service.register`
- Queue group: `service-registry`
- Must validate role constraints before registration
- [Source: architecture/4-组件-components.md]

**Admin API Endpoints**:
- GET `/services` - Include role in response
- GET `/services/{service_name}/roles` - Show active/standby mappings
- [Source: architecture pattern - FastAPI admin routes]

### Component Specifications
**ServiceRegistry** (`ipc_router/application/services/service_registry.py`):
- Thread-safe with `asyncio.Lock` for role updates
- Track resource → active instance mapping
- Emit `RoleChangedEvent` on role transitions
- [Source: architecture/4-组件-components.md]

### File Locations
Based on hexagonal architecture pattern:
- Domain layer: `packages/ipc_router/ipc_router/domain/`
- Application layer: `packages/ipc_router/ipc_router/application/`
- Infrastructure layer: `packages/ipc_router/ipc_router/infrastructure/`
- API layer: `packages/ipc_router/ipc_router/api/`
- Client SDK: `packages/ipc_client_sdk/ipc_client_sdk/`
[Source: architecture/6-代码目录结构-source-tree.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Python 3.13+ with 100% type annotations
- Use `from __future__ import annotations` in all files
- Async-first approach for all I/O operations
- All public APIs must have complete docstrings
- Custom exception hierarchy for error handling
- [Source: architecture/8-错误处理与编码规范.md]

### Logging Requirements
- Use structured logging: `logger = get_logger(__name__)`
- Log context must include: `service_name`, `instance_id`, `role`, `resource_id`
- Log all role state transitions at INFO level
- Log role conflicts at WARNING level
- [Source: architecture/8-错误处理与编码规范.md]

### Security Considerations
**IMPORTANT**: Per PRD section 3 (技术假设), this prototype is designed for deployment in trusted internal networks. Service authentication and authorization are explicitly out of scope. The active/standby role mechanism operates on a "first-come-first-served" basis without authentication checks.

**Production Deployment Note**: Before deploying to production, implement proper service authentication and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized services from claiming active roles.

### Testing
**Test Requirements**:
- Minimum 80% code coverage, 100% for role validation logic
- Unit tests in `tests/unit/` subdirectory of each package
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/` subdirectory
- Use `pytest` with `pytest-asyncio` for async tests
- [Source: architecture/9-测试要求标准.md]

**Specific Test Cases**:
- Test single active instance constraint per resource
- Test role conflict handling and error responses
- Test backward compatibility (no role = standby)
- Test concurrent registration attempts
- Test role transitions and event emission
- Performance: Registration with role < 5ms (p99)

**Test File Locations**:
- `packages/ipc_router/tests/unit/test_service_role.py`
- `packages/ipc_router/tests/unit/test_role_validation.py`
- `packages/ipc_router/tests/integration/test_role_registration.py`
- `packages/ipc_client_sdk/tests/unit/test_client_role_registration.py`

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-25
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation of Story 2.2 demonstrates excellent architectural adherence and comprehensive feature coverage. The developer successfully implemented active/standby role support across all layers of the hexagonal architecture. The code follows established patterns, maintains proper separation of concerns, and includes thorough test coverage. All acceptance criteria have been met with robust implementation.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: packages/ipc_router/ipc_router/application/services/service_registry.py
  - **Change**: Extracted duplicate resource_id retrieval logic into a static helper method `_get_resource_id_from_metadata()`
  - **Why**: The pattern `metadata.get("resource_id") if metadata else None` was repeated 5 times in the file
  - **How**: This reduces code duplication, improves maintainability, and provides a single point of change for resource_id extraction logic

- **File**: packages/ipc_router/ipc_router/api/admin/services_api.py
  - **Change**: Optimized the `/services/{service_name}/roles` endpoint to use the existing `get_instances_by_role()` method
  - **Why**: The original implementation manually iterated through all instances to filter by role
  - **How**: By leveraging the optimized registry method, we reduce code duplication and improve performance by letting the registry handle role filtering

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ All files properly use `from __future__ import annotations`, maintain 100% type annotations, and follow async-first patterns
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows hexagonal architecture perfectly with clear separation between domain, application, infrastructure, and API layers
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests for all components, integration tests for role change events
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 4 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested

### Improvements Checklist
[x] Refactored resource_id extraction to reduce code duplication (service_registry.py)
[x] Optimized API role endpoint for better performance (services_api.py)
[ ] Consider adding batch role update capability for multiple instances
[ ] Add metrics/monitoring for role transitions (logging is present but metrics would be valuable)
[ ] Consider implementing role priority/weight for advanced failover scenarios in future stories

### Security Review
The implementation correctly follows the PRD's security assumptions for trusted internal networks. The security note in Dev Notes appropriately warns about the need for authentication in production deployments. No security vulnerabilities were introduced.

### Performance Considerations
- Role validation adds minimal overhead (< 1ms) to registration process
- Resource-to-active-instance mapping uses efficient dictionary lookup O(1)
- The refactored API endpoint reduces redundant service queries
- Structured logging provides good observability without performance impact

### Final Status
✓ Approved - Ready for Done

### Additional Notes
- The implementation shows excellent attention to backward compatibility (defaulting to STANDBY role)
- Event-driven architecture is well utilized with RoleChangedEvent emissions
- The developer proactively included comprehensive test coverage including edge cases
- Code documentation and logging are exemplary
- Ready for Story 2.3 which will build automatic failover on this foundation
