# Story 2.1: Service Instance Automatic Heartbeat and Health Check Enhancement

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** central routing component,
**I want** service instances to automatically send heartbeats and detect unhealthy instances,
**so that** I can maintain accurate health status for routing decisions and support instance-level retry.

## Current State
- ✅ HeartbeatHandler: Fully implemented to receive and process heartbeats
- ✅ HealthChecker Service: Monitors instances and marks them unhealthy on timeout
- ✅ Health-aware routing: get_healthy_instances() filters unhealthy instances
- ✅ ServiceClient has heartbeat() and start_heartbeat() methods
- ✅ Automatic heartbeat sending: Service instances now send heartbeats automatically after registration
- ✅ Heartbeat configuration: Added heartbeat settings in ServiceClientConfig
- ✅ Instance-level retry: Failed calls can retry on different healthy instances using call_with_failover()

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Service instances automatically send periodic heartbeats after registration
2. Central component marks instances as "unhealthy" based on heartbeat timeout
3. "Unhealthy" instances are removed from the routing pool
4. Failed service calls automatically retry on different healthy instances

## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards
- Test files location: `packages/ipc_router/tests/unit/` and `packages/ipc_router/tests/integration/`
- Use pytest framework with async support
- Mock NATS interactions for unit tests
- Use real NATS container for integration tests
- Achieve minimum 80% code coverage
- Test edge cases: network partitions, slow heartbeats, rapid instance failures

### Architecture Context
- **Existing Infrastructure**: HeartbeatHandler already listens on `ipc.service.heartbeat` topic
- **Health Monitoring**: HealthChecker service already monitors instances with configurable intervals
- **New Additions**:
  - Automatic heartbeat sending from ServiceClient SDK after registration
  - Heartbeat configuration in ServiceClientConfig
  - Instance-level retry logic (different from Story 1.5's message-level retry)
  - Enhanced routing to support instance exclusion

### Message Protocol
- Heartbeat messages use MessagePack envelope format
- Include: instance_id, service_name, timestamp, status, metadata
- Lightweight protocol to minimize overhead

### Integration Points
- **ServiceClient SDK**: Add automatic heartbeat after registration
- **HealthChecker**: Ensure proper health status updates
- **RoutingService**: Add support for excluded instances
- **RouteHandler**: Implement instance-aware error handling

### Configuration
- Heartbeat interval: Configurable per service (default 5s)
- Timeout threshold: Configurable (default 30s, absolute timeout not based on missed beats)
- Health check interval: Router checks every 10s by default
- Instance retry: Max 3 different instances before failing

### Previous Story Context
- Story 1.5 implemented delivery guarantees with retry on same instance
- This story enhances to support retry on different healthy instances
- Builds on existing HeartbeatHandler and HealthChecker infrastructure
- Story 2.2 will handle active/standby role management separately
- Story 2.3 will implement the automatic failover logic

### Key Differences from Story 1.5
- **1.5 Retry**: Retries on same instance for message delivery guarantees
- **2.1 Retry**: Retries on different healthy instances for high availability
- Both retry mechanisms will coexist and serve different purposes

#### Performance Testing Analysis

**Current Scale Testing:**
- ✅ `test_concurrent_heartbeats_performance`: Tests 50 instances (10 services × 5 instances)
  - Validates sub-second processing for 50 concurrent heartbeats
  - All instances remain healthy under test load

**Resource Routing Performance Tests Found:**
- `test_resource_routing_performance.py`: Tests 1000 resources but NOT 1000 instances
- Focus is on resource operations, not heartbeat/health monitoring at scale

#### Critical Findings

1. **All Functional Tests Pass**: Every test related to the 4 acceptance criteria executes successfully
2. **Code Coverage Low**: ~32-42% coverage indicates tests don't exercise all code paths
3. **Scale Testing Gap Confirmed**: No test validates 1000+ concurrent service instances
4. **Demo Scripts Available**: `demo_story_2_1_nats.py` provides full demonstration but not automated testing

#### Recommendations

1. **Critical - Add 1000+ Instance Test**: Create `test_heartbeat_scale_performance.py` to validate:
   - Heartbeat processing for 1000+ concurrent instances
   - Health checker performance with massive instance counts
   - Memory usage under high instance load
   - Failover performance at scale

2. **Important - Improve Code Coverage**: Current tests pass but don't exercise error paths and edge cases

3. **Nice to Have - Chaos Testing**: Add tests for network partitions and random failures

#### Overall Assessment: **PASS with Scale Testing Gap** 🟡

All acceptance criteria are properly tested and passing. The implementation is functionally correct. However, the absence of testing at the 1000+ instance scale mentioned in the story context represents a significant gap for production readiness. The system works correctly but performance at scale is unverified.
